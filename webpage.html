    <p class="poi">Hello there, Iâ€™m a big fan of short sentences. I love them because people can understand them easily. There's an insane amount of value in short sentences that are readable, digestible, and punchy. So I have just included a brief introduction of mine.</p>
    <p class="lkj">I am a student developer interested in Computer Science related topics, interested in technology and a humble learner. Currently I am pretty much interested in web development( Currently---Because priorties change on time in life). Here is a link to go to my first webpage.(Definitely not an expert, so don't have huge expectations, but have designed in a way)
